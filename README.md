## 🚧 Status: Currently Building...

This project is a **work-in-progress** music streaming website, built with classic **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

Right now, I’m working on getting the basic music player working — adding features like:

- Play / Pause / Next / Previous controls
- A stylish, responsive UI
- Integration of local `.mp3` files
- Cookie & privacy policy pages
- SVG-based icons for slick control buttons
- add more playlists

## 🔄 What's Done So Far

- 🎵 Basic folder structure
- 🎧 Songs folder with sample `.mp3` files
- 📄 HTML pages created: Home, Privacy, Legal, etc.
- 🎨 CSS styles applied
- 🧠 JavaScript file initialized

## 🛠️ What's Coming Soon

- ⏯️ Full music playback logic
- 📃 Playlist UI
- 🎛️ Volume and progress bar
- 🌓 Dark mode (maybe!)
- 🔗 Deploy on GitHub Pages

## 👨‍💻 Developer Notes

I’m currently working on this in my free time — so expect regular updates!  
Once the basic player is functional, I’ll start polishing the UI and adding more interactive features.
